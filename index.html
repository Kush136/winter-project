    <h2 class="lighterblue">Step By Step Guide On How to Build a Simple Snowman!</h2>
    <h3 class="blue">Step 1: Making The Snowballs</h3>
    <p class="lightblue">The first step to making any snowman are the snowballs. For the bottom snowball, you need to roll up snow until you have a substantially large snowball. Then, you do the same thing, but you make the snowball slightly smaller. Finally, you do the same thing again, and you make the snowball smaller than the last one.</p>
    <h3 class="blue">Step 2: Building The Body</h3>
    <p class="lightblue">Once you have built your snowballs, you have to build the actual snowman. You first put the medium sized snowball on top of the largest one, then you you place the smallest snowball on top of the medium snowball.</p>
    <h3 class="blue">Step 3: Decorating</h3>
    <p class="lightblue">Now that you have built the snowman, you have to bring it to life! The traditional style is to put a top hat, buttons to make a mouth and eyes, a scarf in between, and a carrot to make a nose on the smallest snowball. Then, you add sticks on either side of the medium snowball. Finally, you put more buttons on the entirety of the snowman to make it look like an actual coat. That is how you make a snowman!</p>
    <div class="border-solid">P.S. Your snowballs should look like this but bigger and a sphere.</div>
